# Introduction
This is an example application that streams data generate from a csv template file. You can try the application by visiting [a heroku hosted version](http://http://testcsvstreamer.herokuapp.com/). 

This application is meant to be a simple working example of [csv_streamer](http://www.github/fawce/csv_builder), which is a fork of csv_builder. csv_streamer adds support for streaming the output of a template as it is generated, to avoid timeouts for generation of very large csv files.
